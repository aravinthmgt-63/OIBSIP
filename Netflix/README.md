This project is a Netflix-inspired homepage built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a responsive and visually appealing UI that closely resembles the original platform. The project also includes a subscription page designed for accessing premium content, showcasing form handling and basic interactivity using JavaScript. This project highlights my front-end development skills, UI design understanding, and ability to create real-world web application layouts.
